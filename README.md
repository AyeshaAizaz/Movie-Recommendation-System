**Movie Recommendation System** <br>
This project is a movie recommendation system developed in PyCharm using Python, Streamlit, and TMDB datasets. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on user selections and preferences. Additionally, users can search for specific movies, view detailed information such as description, genre, and cast, and get recommendations based on their search criteria.
